Demo:

(1)   Toggle LED0 every 1000ms.
(2)   Toggle LED1 when SW_USER is pushed.
(3-1) Echo every three characters through the UART3 using the following sockets.
        RxD3 : J7-D0
        TxD3 : J7-D1
        GND  : J8-G
        Baud rate : 9600bps
(3-2) Blink LED1 faster if parity error, framing error, overrun error or timeout
occurs. The error state is cleared when SW_USER is pushed. */
